- **Colors**: Modify the color scheme in the style definitions
- **Layout**: Adjust spacing, fonts, and content placement
- **Content**: Add or modify certificate text and details
- **Logo**: Add your logo to the certificate (requires image handling)

### Certificate Content
The certificate includes:
- Donor name
- Food item details
- Quantity and location
- Donation date
- Unique certificate number
- Impact statement
- Thank you message

### Styling
The certificate uses ReportLab with custom styles:
- **Title**: Green color (#439249) with bold font
- **Subtitle**: Dark green (#166534) 
- **Body**: Black text with center alignment

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Users can only access certificates for their own donations
- Certificate numbers are unique and trackable

### Data Privacy

- No sensitive information is exposed in URLs
- PDFs are generated on-demand and not stored

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Admin Interface
- Track all certificates in Django admin
- View certificate numbers, donors, and issue dates
- Search and filter certificates

### Logging
Certificate generation is logged for monitoring:
- Successful certificate generation
- Access attempts by unauthorized users
- PDF generation errors
